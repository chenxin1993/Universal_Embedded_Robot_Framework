# System Framework Design Note

[toc]

## The Main Idea of Designing the Robot System
1. Abstract Motor Model and Sensor Model from the Hardware in the real world. This gives the developer more time concentrate on developing the robot algorithm.
	- Even the Bus Communicate System which I developed in the graduate age can be considered as the hardware level, and can therefore be masked when developing the upper level robot algorithms.
